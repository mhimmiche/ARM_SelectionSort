# ARM_SelectionSort
## An implementation of a selection sort in ARM assembly.

The assembly program takes multiple values and performs a selection sort on them, from smallest to largest.
The program allows for more than 5 elements to be compared - the project assignment only asked for 5 but I tried to scale it to alow more.

### Compiling the program
On an arm device, type the following:
`linux
gcc assemblySort.s
`

### Running the program
In order to run the program, type the following:
`linux
./a.out; echo ?$
`
