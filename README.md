# ARM_SelectionSort
## An implementation of a selection sort in ARM assembly.

The assembly program takes multiple values and performs a selection sort on them, from smallest to largest.
The project assignment only asked for 5 but I tried to scale it to alow more. For this code however, it only works to 5 (I am working on having it work for any number.)

### Compiling the program
On an arm device, type the following:
`linux
gcc assemblySort.s
`

### Running the program
In order to run the program, type the following:
`linux
./a.out; echo ?$
`
